When listening to music, I unconsciously generate discrimination based on differences, from blindly praising mainstream music to extreme enthusiasm for niche songs. In my hierarchical mind, there is ethnic emotional opposition which causes me to hold deep prejudices against Korean pop songs. Actually, this is a very arrogant attitude towards listening to music. Excessive self-reflection makes me feel conceited and think that more niche songs demonstrate individuality and narrow-minded patriotism will make me doubt, reject or even slander foreign music.</p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My behavior is very ridiculous. Firstly, it's self-contradictory. I am enthusiastic about second-dimensional culture and listening to Japanese songs, but subconsciously resist Korean music. It seems that I am not a \"loyal patriot\", but rather binding my inner thoughts with the moral banner of \"patriotism\" and practicing differential discrimination through self-deception. The result is an inability to accept diverse cultural information and self-isolation. Moreover, in daily life, I may also hold high the banner of justice under the guise of morality while excluding others and envying their excellence. Secondly, it's a pathological herd mentality that leads me to pursue individuality but ultimately fall into mediocrity. Looking back on where my music discrimination comes from, I attribute it to being swept away by the complex network public opinion without firm principles myself; therefore what I call advocating individuality may be a powerless resistance to following the trend under massive information flow or even feeling guilty for not having true love - resulting in confusion and chaos in thought processes. Therefore, I have decided to rectify my thinking towards past mistakes.</p> <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As an honest child, art knows no boundaries.

My father mentioned \"language discrimination\", which aroused a sense of guilt in me towards others, prompting me to empathize with their reading experience. The moral constraints and ethical standards contained within this sense of guilt are what led me to close off my circle of friends as a \"catalyst\". However, it is also worth reflecting on how to find balance between freedom and constraint, as well as how to solve communication difficulties in intergenerational relationships in a more reasonable way. In the past, I chose the most foolish way out - not communicating at all. Although it was clear that listening, respecting understanding and tolerance could promote healthy development in relationships; however,I was held back by stubborn thoughts: if I complied with them then I would lose.

The status of women was very humble at that time, and women lacked education and enlightenment of knowledge, which directly contributed to the disadvantaged status of women at the social level. The prevailing perception of women in the British environment at the time was that women \"should\" play an accessory role of grace, glamour, and vulnerability.

Jane Eyre is always losing, she is not always so strong, she used to be confused and disturbed and even attributed all the suffering to herself, but Helen is like a ray of light in her life. Fortunately, Jane Eyre's thoughts were struggling the most. When the time comes, her departure is also the beginning of Jane Eyre's spiritual Nirvana. Jane Eyre began to rebel against the secular world. She refused to be a vassal product of any faction, power, or character. In the text, she burst into tears, but she still firmly made the most difficult choice. I can't help but think of Lieutenant Colonel Slade's classic accusation in \"Scent of a Woman\": 'Now I have come to crossroads in my life, I always knew what the right path was. Without exception, I knew, but I never took it, you know why, it was too * hard.' We all know the right way, but do we have the courage to go to her?

We can see that the tear-jerking mythical love stories passed down through generations, such as \"The Cowherd and Weaver Girl\" and \"The Seven Fairies and Dong Yong,\" all have distinct characteristics of their time. The small agricultural economy where men farmed and women wove could support the continuation of civilization. Perhaps marriage relationships were more utilitarian in terms of survival at that time, as people needed a partner to maintain sustainable productivity. Marriage brought about cooperative production relations which provided more development space than individual survival alone, while also catering to social opinion. We still face supervision from parents, relatives, friends and other social relationships: why aren't you getting married? I can say with certainty that even in ancient times or modern society today, most people value marriage as cooperation to cope with greater survival pressure and seek more living space. Marriage does not necessarily equate to concrete love; it is more like a strong bond contract that tightly binds two lives together. Of course motivation and results are not necessarily symmetrical; strong bonds do not necessarily bring bad results either. The older generation around me who talked about their post-marriage life mostly did not have many romantic plots but rather mundane matters such as food supplies or household chores - they completed coexistence within these trivialities. I thought this was a very painful process but after listening later on, you would hear harmony in their frankness; trust built within this contract was surprisingly stronger than blood relationship kinship - I didn't hear blame but instead saw responsibility. This is what Professor Luo expressed as 'love is an emotion guided by responsibility.'

You can see that romance is a feeling and emotion, it is an emotional sensation. It should be understood that emotions are unsustainable and continuously declining. When you first see a cute toy, you may not want to let go of it. But after ten times, one hundred times, one thousand times or even ten thousand times later, will you still treasure it as much? Therefore in today's post-modern society where social productivity has greatly improved and production relations are undergoing unprecedented changes, we no longer need another person to seek more development space; we increasingly emphasize the realization of personal value. In terms of social relationships management strategies have slowly shifted from cooperation to screening. The romanticization of love is an example of social transformation.

Under the development of post-modern society, the liberation of productivity promotes people's pursuit of spirituality. The relationship between men and women is no longer based on factors such as family interests and social status, but rather on whether their inner emotional needs are met. At the same time, the redistribution of rights and responsibilities between men and women is also a factor that drives changes in love. In traditional concepts, men are expected to provide economic value while women are expected to take care of household chores and children. However, this gender-based division of labor is becoming increasingly outdated with social progress. Before a new type of cooperation between men and women can be formed, its development prospects remain unclear; however it will undoubtedly subvert traditional marriage concepts. Regardless of social systems, personal emotions or gender roles perspectives, post-modern society advocates for diversified development in love relationships - it is precisely this diversification that endows love with social rights so as to regulate social conflicts and promote solidarity. Therefore, people do not necessarily demand more from love; instead forms of love are undergoing change.

Quantitative indicators have transformed economics, a discipline that studies social theory, into a science, but at the same time, the development of economics has also continuously demonstrated the importance of quantitative research. But economics is not just a game of numbers. Economic stories will have their advantages and disadvantages because of the different narrative methods in the process of communication. The core idea addressed by Robert J. Shiller in this Narrative of economics is that narrative communication is a very important mechanism of economic change and a key predictor.

I especially liked eating egg pancakes, and even now, I remember clearly how my feelings changed when the price of egg pancakes went from 1.5 yuan to 3 yuan. I wasn't really an ambitious person. In second grade of elementary school, our homeroom teacher asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up? My desk mate answered first: 'I want to be Einstein.'

I never thought about the pressure of moral public opinion in front of dozens of people who admired noble professions such as scientists, doctors, astronauts and so on. Instead, I simply stood up and said: \"When I grow up, I hope to always eat egg pancakes, so it's enough for me to be a master of frying egg pancakes.\" I can't remember the reaction around me at that time, but today, I definitely wouldn't be so rashly \"frank\".

All I knew was that moment in elementary school, where I really hoped to live by making egg pancakes and had high expectations for the world. Later on, it seems like I lost those expectations.

Here are some of my insights:</p>"},{"location":"Article/2023/Read-All-are-%20equal/#words-are-the-proudest-things-in-the-world","title":"Words are the proudest things in the world","text":"<p>Reading is a behavior with strong universality, high flexibility, low marginal cost and strong sustainability. Each of us can read, immersive reading anytime, anywhere. On the surface, reading is a single choice, but I am more certain that reading is an invisible two-way communication. First of all, you choose a book, depending on your reading preferences and pursuit direction, secondly, the result of the choice also proves inversely that you will have an emotional resonance with the spiritual world promoted by the authors. I believe that driven by the post-epidemic era in the Internet age, human beings will pay more attention to spiritual abundance and the filling of their inner world, and the role of books will continue and expand over time. When I read \"The Uncommon Reader\", the power of words is more vividly reflected. Queen Elizabeth II is already one of the few people in the world's power center, but she is even more approachable when she is reading. I started to have the idea of writing my own articles. In front of words, there are no privileged classes, and all living beings are equal. Only if you let go of all the prejudices and prejudices of secular concepts, you will be able to enjoy reading, and books will also feed back to us, a more tolerant and generous way of understanding the world.</p>"},{"location":"Article/2023/Read-All-are-%20equal/#we-should-read-but-not-only-read","title":"We should read, but not only read","text":"<p>Reading is a form of entertainment, but it is also a form of learning. Similar to the reading experience of the Queen, when I first started to contact books when I was a child, as long as it was a book, I accepted it wholeheartedly, but as the amount of reading accumulated, it became more and more important to understand efficient reading methods and establish a reasonable knowledge system. In the process of reading, the queen also picked up the pen and started taking notes. As the old saying goes, \"good memory is not as good as bad writing\". This is a matter of preparation before reading and skills in reading. But more importantly, after reading, we reflect and think. We do not advocate utilitarian reading, but we must reflect on the reading experience. We must understand that the way individuals perceive the world is limited, and reading can effectively increase the breadth and depth of understanding the world.</p>"},{"location":"Article/2023/Read-All-are-%20equal/#the-last","title":"The last","text":"<p>I am very fortunate to read this book \"The Uncommon Reader\", which makes me understand the devotion of human beings to the power in words, and reminds myself all the time that reading is a lifelong thing and should be kept in mind at all times.</p>"},{"location":"Article/2024/1-Semiannual%20Summary/","title":"Go ahead No Back","text":"<p>From the last work record or year-end summary, the record book is afraid of early covered with electronic dust.

Since the first time I read books in such depth, I have stayed in my college days. Still remember a street lamp dim evening self-study evening, looking at clean books slowly attached reading wrinkles, but do not know the knowledge engraved into the brain.
